Simple script to export bookmarks from `ybookmarks.sqlite` (used by the now discontinued [delicious Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/delicious-bookmarks/) to a html file in the [Netscape Bookmark File Format](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa753582%28v=vs.85%29.aspx). 

The script is based on Qiangning Hong's [**RescueDelicious**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RescueDelicious). Thank you for your great work!

This is literally my first Python script. I hope it may still be of use to someone.

## Usage

    d2f.py <your-ybookmarks.sqlite-file>

This will create a file called "fbm.html", containing all your bookmarks in the Netscape Bookmark File Format.
This file can be imported to Firefox as described here: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-bookmarks-html-file.

## Details

### Tag to Folder Conversion
Tags used in delicious are converted to folders in the html file.
Note, that as a result any bookmark previously containing more than one tag will be duplicated in the newly created `fbm.html`.

### ybookmarks.sqlite
The `ybookmarks.sqlite` file is located in your Firefox [profile folder](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data).

###  Motivation

Wanting to migrate from delicious to Firefox' built-in bookmarks-management, I did not find working solution to export my bookmarks from the delicious.com website.
