# delicious2firefox
## Synopsis

Simple script that can be used to export bookmarks from the sqlite database (_ybookmarks.sql_) used by the delicious Firefox add-on. to the Netscape Bookmark File Format https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa753582%28v=vs.85%29.aspx. 

The script is based on Qiangning Hong's **RescueDelicious**. Thank you for your great work!

## Usage

    d2f.py <your-ybookmarks.sql-file>

This will create a file called "fbm.html", containing all your bookmarks in the Netscape Bookmark File Format.
This file can be imported to Firefox as described here: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-bookmarks-html-file.

## Motivation

Wanting to migrate from delicious to Firefox' built-in bookmarks-management, I did not find a working or satisfying way to export my bookmarks from delicious.
